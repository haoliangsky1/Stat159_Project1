Surfing on the edge of exploding information and data, the need for reproducible approach of scientific research is growing. This paper is trying to answer some of the very basic questions in reproducibility: what are some important tools, and what roles do they play in the reproducible workflow.


In the following paragraphs, we will discuss `Markdown` and how it modularized and simplifies the compiling process; `Git` and how this version control system helps to track development and enable collaborative working style; `GitHub` and how its source code management system and distributed version control makes collaboration and open source projects more accessible; `pandoc` and how it helps scholarly writing and workflow publishing; and `Markdown` and how it makes formatting on computer as easy as on paper.
