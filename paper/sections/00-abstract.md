# Statistics 159: Reproducible and Collaborative Research and Data Science Project 1

## Abstract

This is a paper about how I make use of the computational tools covered so far in the course in order to complete this project assignment for Statistics 159, Fall 2016 at UC Berkeley.


In this paper, I will talk about some of the essential tools and the roles they play in reproducible workflow, primarily including `Makefile`, `Git`, `GitHub`, `Pandoc`, and `Markdown`.


Also, I will talk about what kind of resources and help I used in order to finish this job, which parts are challenging, which parts are relatively straightforward, and how much time I spent on this project.
