# Abstract

This is a paper about how I make use of the computational tools covered so far in the course in order to complete this project assignment.


In this paper, I will talk about some of the essential tools and the roles they play in reproducible workflow, including `Makefile`, `Git`, `GitHub`, `pandoc`, and `Markdown`.


Also, I will talk about the resources that I used in order to complete this job, the relatively straightforward and more challenge parts in the process.
