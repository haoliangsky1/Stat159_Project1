## Conclusion

From the discussion above, we see that a few tools are essential in the reproducible workflow. `Makefile` streamlines the compiling process, `Git` makes version control and collaborative development clear and straightforward, `GitHub` helps us to see and use each other work with its remote repository, opening source for the public, `pandoc` makes typesetting and academic writing readable and pretty, and `markdown` enables the content to be converted into multiple formats for specific purpose.


The quest of creating the culture of reproducible and collaborative science would not be easy. With these tools, I hope that more and more people would be willing to and be able to join the community of open-source scientific research.
